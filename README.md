# Subnetting Calculators

Created for everyone, this repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to calculate subnet masks for various networking scenarios. 

## Features

- **Basic Subnet Calculator:** Calculate subnet masks based on the number of subnet bits.
- **IP Address Validation:** Validate IP addresses before calculating subnet masks.
- **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) Calculator:** Calculate subnet masks for multiple subnets with different sizes.
- **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Calculator:** Compute CIDR notation based on the network address and significant bits.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies. Can be run with a standard Python 3.x installation.
