# Subnetting Calculators

Created for everyone, this repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to calculate subnet masks for various networking scenarios. Whether you're a beginner learning about IP addressing and subnets or a network professional dealing with complex enterprise-level subnetting, these calculators cover a range of use cases.

## Calculators

### 1. Basic Subnet Calculator
This calculator allows you to calculate subnet masks based on the number of subnet bits. It provides a simple and straightforward way to understand basic subnetting concepts.

### 2. Subnet Calculator with IP Address Validation
This calculator takes an IP address as input and validates it. After validation, you can calculate the subnet mask using the number of subnet bits.

### 3. Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) Calculator
The VLSM calculator is designed for scenarios where different subnets have different sizes. It calculates subnet masks for multiple subnets with varying sizes, allowing for efficient utilization of IP addresses.

### 4. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Calculator
The CIDR calculator calculates CIDR notation based on a given network address and the number of significant bits. CIDR notation is commonly used in routing and IP address allocation.

### 5. Easy Subnet Calculator - Beginner-Friendly Subnetting Tool
simplified subnetting tool designed specifically for beginners. It takes a network IP address and the number of subnet bits as input, providing subnet mask, network address, and broadcast address as output. It aims to be beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

### 6. Mega Subnet Calculator - All of the above!

## Usage
Each calculator is a separate Python script. You can run the calculators individually based on your specific subnetting needs. Simply input the required information as prompted, and the calculators will provide the necessary output.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies. Can be run with a standard Python 3.x installation.
